Showing how you can embed and functioning auto-encoder inside a webpage using tensorflow.js.

This was inspired by the learning I did through reading David Foster's book [Generative Deep Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781492041931/) which explained how to build an auto-encoder in keras.
